    <h1>INDIAN FESTIVALS</h1>

    <h2>Onam</h2>

    <p>The story of Onam centers on King Mahabali, a generous and beloved ruler of a golden era in Kerala, whose growing popularity made the gods anxious. They requested Lord Vishnu's help, and he appeared as the dwarf Vamana. Vamana asked Mahabali for a portion of land, and with his first two steps covered the earth and sky. To keep his promise, Mahabali offered his own head for Vamana's third step, which sent him to the underworld. Lord Vishnu then granted Mahabali the boon to visit his kingdom once a year, which is celebrated as Onam.</p>

    <h2>Diwali</h2>

    <p>The most popular Diwali story tells of Prince Rama's triumphant return to his kingdom after defeating the demon king Ravana and completing 14 years of exile, with people lighting lamps to guide his path home and symbolize the triumph of good over evil. However, Diwali also celebrates other events, such as Lord Krishna's defeat of the demon Narakasura in South India and the day Lord Mahavira attained nirvana for Jains. The overarching theme of Diwali, regardless of the specific story, is the victory of light over darkness, good over evil, and new beginnings.</p>

    <h2>Holi</h2>

    </center>
    <p>The main Holi story tells of the demon king Hiranyakashipu, his son Prahlad, and the demoness Holika, illustrating the triumph of good over evil through Prahlad's unwavering devotion to Lord Vishnu, who saved him from a fire set by his aunt. Another significant legend features Radha and Krishna, where Krishna, shy about his dark skin, was encouraged by his mother to color Radha's face, celebrating their union with colors.</p>
