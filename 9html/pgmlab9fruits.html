    <p>Fruits are a good source of vitamins and minerals, recognized for their role in preventing vitamin C and vitamin A deficiencies. 
    They are an important part of a healthy eating pattern.Fruits are the mature, ripened ovary of a flowering plant that contains seeds, although some, like bananas, are seedless. While botanically this includes items like tomatoes, cucumbers, and beans, the common definition refers to sweet and fleshy plant products like apples, bananas, and oranges. Fruits are a nutritious part of a diet, providing vitamins, minerals, and fiber that can benefit heart health, digestion, and skin.
