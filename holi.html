<p> The main Holi story tells of the demon king Hiranyakashipu, his son Prahlad, and the demoness Holika, illustrating the triumph of good over evil through Prahlad's unwavering devotion to Lord Vishnu, who saved him from a fire set by his aunt. Another significant legend features Radha and Krishna, where Krishna, shy about his dark skin, was encouraged by his mother to color Radha's face, celebrating their union with colors.</p>
