<p>The most popular Diwali story tells of Prince Rama's triumphant return to his kingdom after defeating the demon king Ravana and completing 14 years of exile, with people lighting lamps to guide his path home and symbolize the triumph of good over evil. However, Diwali also celebrates other events, such as Lord Krishna's defeat of the demon Narakasura in South India and the day Lord Mahavira attained nirvana for Jains. The overarching theme of Diwali, regardless of the specific story, is the victory of light over darkness, good over evil, and new beginnings.</p>
