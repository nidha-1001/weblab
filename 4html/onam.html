<p>The story of Onam centers on King Mahabali, a generous and beloved ruler of a golden era in Kerala, whose growing popularity made the gods anxious. They requested Lord Vishnu's help, and he appeared as the dwarf Vamana. Vamana asked Mahabali for a portion of land, and with his first two steps covered the earth and sky. To keep his promise, Mahabali offered his own head for Vamana's third step, which sent him to the underworld. Lord Vishnu then granted Mahabali the boon to visit his kingdom once a year, which is celebrated as Onam.</p>
